## explanation:
## sed -i (in place replacement)
## /#[0-9]\+[^]]/ search for issues #XXX at the beginning of a line or after a space
## and apply the substition command just to this numbers
## {s/#\([0-9]\+\)/[#\1](https:\/\/github.com\/lgatto\/MSnbase\/issues\/\1)/g;}
## build the link
## "h" copy the result into the "hold space" (initial empty)
## ${x;/./{x;q1};x;q0} when add the end of file "$", swap "hold" and "pattern"
## space via "x", if now anything was found in the "pattern" space "/./" swap
## again and return 1 (q1); if nothing was found also swap and return 0 (q0)
