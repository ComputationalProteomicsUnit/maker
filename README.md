been updated to be run outside of the package directory and reduce
external `Rscript` dependencies.

## Integrate `maker` into your project

Our version of `maker` is meant to be installed and run outside of the
package directory. Start by cloning `maker` (for example in the base
directory that contains your `R` package(s)), create the appropriate
symlinks and use it.

	git clone git@github.com:ComputationalProteomicsUnit/maker.git
	ln -s maker/Makefile .
	make help
